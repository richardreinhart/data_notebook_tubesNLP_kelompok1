"Here’s a rundown of what we can expect from each presidential candidate when it comes to gun policy:

Harris on Gun Policy

Harris has a long history of working with gun policy: She did so when she held a string of district attorney offices in the 1990s and 2000s and when she became California’s attorney general in the 2010s.",Donald Trump,2
"Throughout those periods, she encouraged the development of stricter restrictions on gun ownership, as well as stronger enforcement of existing regulations.",Donald Trump,2
"Later, as a U.S. senator, Harris worked on legislation to mandate universal background checks and to better regulate gun dealer licensing.",Donald Trump,2
"She has in the past also called for both a ban on and a mandatory buyback of assault weapons, although Webster says studies suggest that assault weapon bans can be evaded too easily to impact violence rates.",Donald Trump,1
"In 2022, during the Biden-Harris administration, Congress passed the first sweeping gun legislation in nearly three decades.",Donald Trump,2
"This included important funding mechanisms, as well as a few policy changes, such as requiring stronger background checks on gun buyers under 21 years old, requiring more gun sellers to conduct background checks and broadening a measure meant to keep guns away from domestic violence offenders.",Donald Trump,2
"The latter now include those who have abused dating partners, as well as spouses and close family members.",Donald Trump,2
"The single most effective policy to reduce gun deaths, according to Webster’s research, is an independent licensing process for gun ownership—not merely a background check managed by gun dealers themselves—that includes vetting the fingerprints and other information an applicant provides.",Donald Trump,2
Webster also finds positive results from regulations that take guns away from domestic violence offenders.,Donald Trump,2
"President Joe Biden created a White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which Harris oversees and which works on policies at both the state and local levels.",Donald Trump,2
"“This is the first office of gun violence prevention that was initiated in the White House and overseen by a vice president,” says Joseph Richardson, Jr., a medical anthropologist at the University of Maryland.",Donald Trump,2
"“I don’t think most Americans are even aware that she runs that office.”

That office and the 2022 legislation both go beyond policies directly related to gun access.",Donald Trump,1
"For example, Richardson studies community violence intervention programs, which he says have been shown to reduce shootings when they are allowed to operate for at least three to five years.",Donald Trump,2
"Both Webster and Rosanna Smart, an economist at the nonprofit think tank RAND and co-director of its Gun Policy in America initiative, say that because U.S. gun violence is related to a wide variety of socioeconomic factors, policies directly related to guns—while crucial in themselves—are not the only necessary step.",Donald Trump,2
"For example, given that more than half of gun deaths are caused by suicide, reducing fatalities also requires improving living situations and mental health care.",Donald Trump,1
"Most of all, Webster says, gun violence is about desperate conditions.",Donald Trump,0
“It’s not just race; it’s not just poverty.,Donald Trump,1
"It’s very concentrated disadvantage that really shuts off constrained social networks and opportunities to thrive,” he says.",Donald Trump,0
"Harris nods to this broader approach on her campaign website, mentioning gun violence prevention programs in particular.",Donald Trump,1
At campaign rallies she has discussed the damage done by school shootings and active shooter drills.,Donald Trump,1
"She has also met with survivors of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, who are old enough to vote in a presidential election for the first time this year.",Donald Trump,1
"Still, some experts say two key policy approaches with demonstrated effects in reducing gun violence, particularly among younger people, seem to be missing from Harris’s campaign.",Donald Trump,0
Smart says she has found particularly strong evidence that laws implementing stricter minimum age requirements for purchasing firearms reduce gun suicides in young people.,Donald Trump,1
"Laws that either make guns less accessible to children or penalize owners if their gun is accessed by a child also reduce all types of gun violence among young people, Smart says.",Donald Trump,1
"During the September 10 presidential debate with Trump, Harris pointed to her experience prosecuting gun traffickers—but she also noted that both she and her running mate, Minnesota’s governor Tim Walz, are gun owners, and she said they didn’t intend to take away anyone’s guns.",Donald Trump,2
"During the vice presidential debate held on October 1, Walz noted that the quest to find causes of gun violence can be distractions.",Donald Trump,1
"“I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat,” he said.",Donald Trump,0
"“Sometimes it just is the guns.”

Trump on Gun Policy

Trump, meanwhile, has explicitly positioned himself as a friend to gun owners and “defender of the Second Amendment”; his campaign has even set up a “Gun Owners for Trump” web page.",Donald Trump,2
"As president in 2017–2021, he loosened some restrictions around gun ownership, ensured gun sales could continue during early COVID shutdowns and appointed some 200 federal judges with gun-friendly records.",Donald Trump,2
"Yet Trump also banned bump stocks, attachments that allow semiautomatic guns to shoot faster; the Supreme Court, including all three justices appointed by Trump, overturned that rule in June.",Donald Trump,1
"In 2022 the court overturned a New York State provision limiting concealed carry of weapons, the implications of which are still being determined.",Donald Trump,1
"Given federal inaction, most gun regulation happens at the state level—but rulings like the one in the New York State case undermine states’ authority, says Garen Wintemute, a physician and chair in violence prevention at the University of California, Davis, who studies gun violence.",Donald Trump,0
Earlier this year Trump spoke at the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting in conjunction with the group’s endorsement of his candidacy.,Donald Trump,2
Since then Trump has endured two assassination attempts that involved guns: one at a July campaign rally in Pennsylvania and one in September at his golf course in Florida.,Donald Trump,0
These incidents have shown no sign of changing his stance.,Donald Trump,2
"Trump has also owned firearms, although his felony convictions this spring suspended his right to own guns.",Donald Trump,0
"Wintemute says the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol—which came after Trump sowed doubt about his loss in the 2020 election—could have been far deadlier without the existing gun control measures.",Donald Trump,0
"Although some of the January 6 rioters brought firearms, others chose not to because of Washington, D.C.’s strict gun laws.",Donald Trump,1
"Wintemute now worries that Trump’s rhetoric about political violence, combined with existing gun regulation (or even potentially weakened restrictions, should Trump win the White House again next month) could have disastrous consequences for democracy in the U.S.

Trump’s running mate, Senator J. D. Vance of Ohio, has called school shootings “a fact of life” and “increasingly the reality we live in.” The official Republican platform calls for “hardening” schools (through steps such as adding physical security and arming teachers), even though some data show this doesn’t reduce gun violence.",Donald Trump,0
"We’ve got to make the windows stronger.” Additional campaign materials cite diverting student “troublemakers” to correctional facilities, encouraging teachers to carry concealed weapons, and bringing veterans and retired police officers into schools as armed guards.",Donald Trump,0
"The 2024 Republican platform also promises to defend constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms, but it doesn’t mention many specific policies an administration would pursue.",Donald Trump,1
"Project 2025, a 900-page conservative policy blueprint that Trump has denounced, despite the fact that it was written by several key associates of his and Vance’s, also dedicates surprisingly little space to gun policy.",Donald Trump,1
It does suggest that Congress should move the agency that oversees firearms out of the Department of Justice and into that of the Treasury—a move that critics say would weaken enforcement of gun policies.,Donald Trump,0
"One key policy that Trump has expressed interest in throughout the campaign, and has promised to sign, is concealed carry reciprocity legislation that would erode concealed weapon bans where they do exist.",Donald Trump,0
"Smart says her research shows that policies permitting concealed guns are associated with higher death rates, as are “stand your ground” laws (the latter permit the use of fatal violence in self-defense without attempting to retreat first).",Donald Trump,0
"Overall, a Trump administration would likely do little to address gun violence—and have potentially dangerous long-term consequences stemming from Trump’s reshaping of the courts.",Donald Trump,0
"In contrast, several of the policies Harris calls for could reduce gun violence, but the effects might not be felt right away, given the current prevalence of guns in the U.S.",Donald Trump,0

"CNN —

Top aides to Kamala Harris are heading into the final month of the 2024 presidential race still wrestling with how much distance she can credibly claim from Joe Biden as she looks for more ways to weave in breaks with him on the campaign trail.",Donald Trump,0
But she keeps getting pulled back to his side for official business at the White House — and he keeps injecting himself into the conversation.,Donald Trump,0
"Harris aides are looking at rolling out new plans and promises for what Harris would do as president, in part to directly demonstrate notable differences, like in her recent more blunt speeches about abortion rights and tackling the southern border.",Donald Trump,2
"“The challenge” of having so little time left in such a short race, one adviser to the vice president told CNN, is “when you’re trying to reach undecided low-intensity voters, how do you actually communicate difference with Biden?”

Running as an extension of the president is not a strong position, Harris aides know, while asserting what she stands for is.",Donald Trump,0
Neither aides in the Harris campaign nor the Biden White House would commit to another joint campaign event between now and the election.,Donald Trump,0
"Harris wants to create space, top aides say, but not too much space.",Donald Trump,1
She wants to be loyal — but she also wants to win.,Donald Trump,1
"She is still planning to lean on Biden, who is flying to Milwaukee on Tuesday for an event trumpeting more projects made possible by administration efforts, to buck up union members or to park himself in battleground Pennsylvania for political stops in the final weeks.",Donald Trump,1
But no one on the vice president’s team is upset that Biden is headed to spend a whole week of October overseas on a non-pressing diplomatic trip to Germany and Angola.,Donald Trump,1
Some wish he’d go away for longer.,Donald Trump,0
"Part of leading Democrats’ focus on Biden is seeing him as the albatross embodiment for the unsettling feeling spreading among Democrats that the vice president is not — or at least, not yet — where she needs to be to win in just over four weeks.",Donald Trump,0
"Still haunted by the 2016 election, they’re frustrated and despairing that even now, seemingly no number of Donald Trump’s offensive statements, lies, lack of plans or legal problems can shake his support.",Donald Trump,0

The balance is tricky for a vice president squeezed between battered voters desperate for change; Republicans responding to her every new proposal by asking why she hasn’t implemented them already; and an incumbent president whose numbers have been going up with some of the core constituencies she needs.,Donald Trump,0
"Biden’s and Harris’ separate appearances surveying Hurricane Helene damage on Wednesday is like much of what’s to come: “singing from the same song sheet,” as Biden put it on Friday — but rarely having them side by side.",Donald Trump,0
Even that was a source of tension: Biden’s decision to go to North Carolina earlier in the week meant that Harris had to hold off on her own trip to a state that she is in an intense fight to win.,Donald Trump,0
"No issue for Harris is thornier than the escalating violence in the Middle East ahead of the anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks: With hundreds of thousands of votes on the line in battleground Michigan alone, a range of leaders are pushing her to explicitly distance herself from Biden, people familiar with the discussions tell CNN.",Donald Trump,0

Internal Harris campaign research on the September presidential debate found that one of the most popular moments for the vice president was when she said, “Clearly, I am not Joe Biden.”

On Friday, after weeks of some junior White House aides complaining to colleagues about having to run statements and other ideas by the campaign, Biden took a different approach.",Donald Trump,1

Trump as ‘the tired, old past,’ with Harris as ‘the future’

Separating from Trump is much less awkward than separating from Biden, and leading Harris supporters in battleground states told CNN that may be the only real way out of what one called “the ultimate balancing act.”

Top aides to Kamala Harris are heading into the final month of the 2024 presidential race still wrestling with how much distance she can credibly claim from Joe Biden as she looks for more ways to weave in breaks with him on the campaign trail.",Kamala Harris,1

"She is still planning to lean on Biden, who is flying to Milwaukee on Tuesday for an event trumpeting more projects made possible by administration efforts, to buck up union members or to park himself in battleground Pennsylvania for political stops in the final weeks.",Kamala Harris,2

"Part of leading Democrats’ focus on Biden is seeing him as the albatross embodiment for the unsettling feeling spreading among Democrats that the vice president is not — or at least, not yet — where she needs to be to win in just over four weeks.",Kamala Harris,0

"The former president and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, are trying to make Harris out to be the incumbent, talking as if she had been the one signing executive orders for the past three years.",Kamala Harris,0
The balance is tricky for a vice president squeezed between battered voters desperate for change; Republicans responding to her every new proposal by asking why she hasn’t implemented them already; and an incumbent president whose numbers have been going up with some of the core constituencies she needs.,Kamala Harris,0
"Biden’s and Harris’ separate appearances surveying Hurricane Helene damage on Wednesday is like much of what’s to come: “singing from the same song sheet,” as Biden put it on Friday — but rarely having them side by side.",Kamala Harris,1
Even that was a source of tension: Biden’s decision to go to North Carolina earlier in the week meant that Harris had to hold off on her own trip to a state that she is in an intense fight to win.,Kamala Harris,0
"No issue for Harris is thornier than the escalating violence in the Middle East ahead of the anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks: With hundreds of thousands of votes on the line in battleground Michigan alone, a range of leaders are pushing her to explicitly distance herself from Biden, people familiar with the discussions tell CNN.",Kamala Harris,0
But her aides know there can’t be any daylight when she’s also sitting at his right hand in the Situation Room.,Kamala Harris,1
"But the economy remains the most frustrating for them, with voters still complaining about a recovery that keeps coming in stronger than almost any expert predicted.",Kamala Harris,0

"Then her aides had to spend hours negotiating with their White House counterparts to scale back a victory lap speech Biden planned to give the next day, according to a person familiar with the matter.",Kamala Harris,0
"Asked what kind of role she would want Biden to have in the last stretch of Harris’ campaign, given how both the situation in Israel and economic frustrations are reverberating through her home state, Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell said, “That’s a complicated question.”

Dingell, a longtime booster of Biden who is once again sounding the alarm in her “blue wall” state, declined to say more.",Kamala Harris,1
"‘I am not Joe Biden’ vs. ‘a major player in everything we’ve done’

Internal Harris campaign research on the September presidential debate found that one of the most popular moments for the vice president was when she said, “Clearly, I am not Joe Biden.”

On Friday, after weeks of some junior White House aides complaining to colleagues about having to run statements and other ideas by the campaign, Biden took a different approach.",Kamala Harris,1
"“She was a major player in everything we’ve done, including the passage of legislation which we were told we could never pass,” Biden said.",Kamala Harris,2
"“She’s been, and her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we’re doing.”

Aides say Biden’s decision to show up in the White House briefing room for his first time ever as president was aimed at breaking through to Americans a sense of a good week, in holding off more violence in the Middle East, ending the dockworkers’ strike and another strong monthly jobs report.",Kamala Harris,1

Harris aides did not find the appearance helpful.",Kamala Harris,0
It was akin to how they felt on Thursday when Biden edged himself into the news by walking over to reporters so he could praise former Rep. Liz Cheney’s speech endorsing Harris.,Kamala Harris,0
"The Trump campaign and other high-profile Republicans, meanwhile, immediately pounced on how Biden effectively bigfooted Harris with his briefing room appearance, walking out two minutes after she took the stage at a campaign event in Detroit.",Kamala Harris,0
"In mid-September, the Democratic research and polling initiative Blueprint conducted a national poll testing a long series of potential statements Harris could make about herself and Biden.",Kamala Harris,1
"Those that performed best, the polling found, “were those that displayed a clear break between her and Biden,” while those that performed worst were “those that portrayed a future Harris administration as building on the accomplishments of the Biden era.”

Any mention of Biden, the polling found, led to less support even if the position it had Harris taking was the same.",Kamala Harris,0
Those numbers have made their way around Harris aides.,Kamala Harris,1
“She hasn’t been afraid to say in places where she’s different from him.,Kamala Harris,2
"He’s got no problem with that,” said Mitch Landrieu, a former Biden White House infrastructure coordinator who was a co-chair of Biden’s campaign and now has the same role for Harris.",Kamala Harris,2

"Trump as ‘the tired, old past,’ with Harris as ‘the future’
